			<span class="heading">How I came to programming</span>
			<p>
				(For anyone who cares)
			</p>
			<p>
				I developed my passion for programming early - I was somewhere
				around 8 years old when my father suggested trying out
				the graphical programming language <a class="fancy-link" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>
				for fun. It got me hooked immediately, but after 3 years I switched to
				Python, as I was annoyed with the limitations of Scratch. I did
				some small things with it, for example a very basic text based RPG
				and a chatbot with fixed responses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, I discovered web development - primarily JavaScript, because
				programming was still what I liked the most. But as with Python,
				the biggest website I made contained nothing but an ancient-looking
				calculator.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I switched to Java. This is the programming language I used
				for my more notable projects. The ones which I am most proud of
				are <a class="fancy-link" href="projects/synthesizer.html">Synthesizer</a>,
				<a class="fancy-link" href="projects/launchpadInterface.html">LaunchpadInterface</a>
				and <a class="fancy-link" href="projects/launchpadAPI.html">LaunchpadAPI</a>, a
				newer, better, more flexible and cooler version of
				LaunchpadInterface.
